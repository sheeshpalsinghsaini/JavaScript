/**
 * When to Use Dot vs. Bracket Notation:
        Dot Notation: Use it when you know the exact name of the property and it doesnâ€™t contain special characters or spaces.
        Bracket Notation: Use it when the property name is dynamic or contains special characters.

//Object Destructuring: allows you to extract specific properties from an object and assign them to variables.

// Renaming Vraible in Destrucuring:

// Spread Operator(...) in Objects: allow to create a shallow copy of an object or to merge multiple objects together.
