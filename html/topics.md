HTML Basics:

    HTML Syntax and Structure:
        Understanding the basic structure of an HTML document (<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>).

        Absolute vs. relative URLs.
        Adding links to different parts of the same page (using id and href).

    Images and Media:
        Embedding images using <img> and understanding src, alt, title attributes.
        Working with audio (<audio>) and video (<video>) elements.

    HTML Forms:

        Understanding form submission and the action, method attributes.

Intermediate HTML:

    Tables:
        Creating tables with <table>, <tr>, <td>, <th>.
        Adding captions, and understanding the use of <thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot>.

    Semantic HTML5 Elements:
        Understanding and using semantic elements like <article>, <section>, <aside>, <figure>, <figcaption>.

    HTML Entities:
        Using special characters and symbols (&nbsp;, &copy;, &euro;, etc.).

    Forms and Validation:
        HTML5 form validation attributes (required, pattern, min, max, etc.).

Advanced HTML:

    Meta Tags and SEO:
        Understanding <meta> tags for setting page description, character set (charset), viewport settings for responsive design, etc.
        Best practices for SEO with HTML.

    Responsive Design:
        Using the <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> tag.
        Understanding media queries (although this leans into CSS, understanding how HTML supports responsive design is crucial).

    Accessibility (A11Y):

    Embedding Content:

Practice and Projects:

    Building a Personal Website:
        Start by creating a simple personal or portfolio website. Focus on structure, semantics, and accessibility.

    Working with Templates:
        Use open-source HTML templates to understand how more complex pages are structured.

    Interactive Forms:
        Create complex forms with validation and test them across different browsers.

By following this path, you'll build a strong foundation in HTML, which will make learning ReactJS much easier and more intuitive.
